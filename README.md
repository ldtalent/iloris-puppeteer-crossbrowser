# Node.js Web Scraper With Puppeteer

My name is Ilori Stephen A and I am a full-stack software developer based in West Africa, Lagos Nigeria and this project is a simple **Web Scraper** built in **Nodejs**. I have written a Blog covering this topic on [Learning Dollars](https://blog.learningdollars.com). You can read up on this **Article** there.

## Project Requirements

1. Make sure you have the latest version of **Nodejs** and **npm** installed.

2. Clone this project to your workspace directory or any directory that pleases you on your machine.

3. Open this project up in your terminal and run the command `npm install` in your terminal.

4. The command listed above will install the needed dependencies for this project to run.

5. You can open your `package.json` and check under the `"scripts" key` in the `json file`. You will find a list of commands provided for scraping.

## Websites

In this project, We experimented with `Jumia:` An E-commerce website in Africa that uses a Busines to Business flow. We scraped the `laptop catalog` under this website. You can open the `app folder` and edit the file `BasicScraper.js` if you'd like to hack.

We also experimented with `webscraper.io:` A website that provides some sample website for scraping. They also sell some useful plugins that could be used for scraping.

You can make a `fork this project and make a pull request` if you know you have some ideas you'd like to implement extending this project further. Once again, my name is Ilori Stephen A and I am currently looking for a Job. You can download my `Resume` from [My CV](https://blog.learningdollars.com).
